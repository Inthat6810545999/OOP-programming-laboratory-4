# Creature Battle Project (OOP + Git Branching Practice)
#Inthat 6810545999

This project is designed to help me learn **object-oriented programming** in Python — especially **inheritance** — while also practicing key **Git concepts** like branching, merging, conflict resolution, and version history.

I begin with a base class (`Creature`) and create additional subclasses on separate Git branches to simulate a real development workflow.

---

## Learning Objectives

### Python / OOP
- Understand and implement **classes**
- Use **inheritance** to extend behaviors
- Override and extend methods (e.g., `attack()`)
- Practice writing simple test code in `main`

### Git / Version Control
- Create and switch branches
- Merge branches into `main`
- Resolve merge conflicts
- View commit history (`git log --graph --all`)

## How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal in the `oop_creature_code` folder  
2. Run the file:

You will see the test output for:

- Creature  
- FlyingCreature  
- SwimmingCreature  
- FireCreature  

---

## Git Workflow Summary

- `main` branch contains the final merged classes  
- `flying_creature` branch introduces FlyingCreature  
- `swimming_creature` branch introduces SwimmingCreature  
- Merge conflict occurred when merging both branches into main  
- Conflict resolved manually  
- `fire_creature` branch adds FireCreature and test code

## Final Submission

I will push this repository to GitHub and submit the link.
